### Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL REST api

Made from scratch. I initially coded out 

  - the getters/setters
  - DAO crud functionalities with SQL statements using JDBC to connect with my DB
  - dealt with cors issues
  - lacked any real project structure

Which I eventually refactored after more research by

  - adding Lombok dependency
  - switching to Spring Data JPA
  - taking advantage of Spring Boot Annotations
  - implementing an MVC project pattern
  - used chatGPT to create some JSON test data
